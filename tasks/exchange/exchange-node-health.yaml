# To Do:
# Set fact replication checks passed
# Set fact replication checks that have failed, if replication checks passed !true
# Set fact component state active
# Set fact component state serverwideoffline if true
#   Components expected to be inactive are 'ForwardSyncDaemon' & 'ProvisioningRps'
# Set fact any databases mounted
# Set fact all databases are healthy (active or mounted)
# Set fact any indexstates not healthy
# Set fact any copyqueuelengths above 10
# Set fact any replayqueuelengths above 10
# Set fact unhealthy databases if conditions above are !true

# Done:
# Set fact Node State
# Set fact all services running
# Set fact services not running, if all services running !true
