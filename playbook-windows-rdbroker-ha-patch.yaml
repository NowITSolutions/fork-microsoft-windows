# Requirements:
#   Inventory Example with Variables:
#     Inventory Group:
#       "DC1 Brokers"
#         "vm_vcenter: vcenter.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_datacenter: DC1"
#     Inventory Hosts:
#       "DC1-BROKER01.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-BROKER01"
#       "DC1-BROKER02.yourdomain.com"
#         "vm_name: DC1-BROKER02"
#
#    Playbook Variables Examples:
#      connection_port: 5986
#      connection_type: winrm
#      connection_transport: kerberos
#      connection_cert_validation: ignore
#      windows_update_mode: all
#
#    Credentials Variables Examples:
#      WinRM Credentials:
#        # Notice the capitalised domain.
#        winrm_username: winrm@YOURDOMAIN.COM
#        winrm_password: insertpasswordhere
#      vCenter Credentials:
#        vm_vcenter_username" vcenter@yourdomain.com
#        vm_vcenter_password: insertpasswordhere
#
#    Optional Playbook Requirements:
#      Kerberos:
#        For Kerberos to work, you will need to create a '/etc/krb5.conf' file (see example-krb5.conf in Git Repo)
#
#  Known Issues:
#    1: There seems to be some issues when running "RemoteDesktop" Powershell module CMDLETS.
#       These issues seem to be when the module is used in remote sessions (WinRM or Remote PSSessions).
#       The unfortunate way i have worked around this issue (for now), is by creating, running and then deleting Scheduled Tasks.
#       For some tasks the Scheduled Task will output a JSON file that Ansible will read, other tasks will be verified in a separate Ansible task.
#
#    2: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has some known issues where it hangs and times out.
#       Sometimes restarting the play and/or rebooting the inventory host fixes the issue, but not always.
#         ref: https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.windows/issues/516
#
#    3: The 'win_updates' Ansible Module has been stuggling with some Windows Updates getting stuck in an update looks.
#       This seems to be a common issue in Windows, specifically with Defender upates (this is not an issue with Ansible, but with Windows).
#       You may find you need to exclude these updates from this play.
#       You can exclude updated by KB or Description by passing the following variable to the Ansible play:
#         reject_updates:
#           - KB2267602
#           - '.*Defender.*'
